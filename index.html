				<h2> KLL's Reconstruction Phase Begins as its Earthquake Response Comes to a Close
</h2>
				<p>Kathmandu Living Labs closes QuakeMap.org, marking the move from earthquake response to reconstruction. Work on School Infrastructure Damage Assessment (SIDA) accelerates. The updated OpenStreetMap data--created by the work of 9,000 volunteers from around the world--continues to serve as an important resource. Meanwhile, KLL begins working with partners in the Nepal government and major international organizations on a housing damage assessment. The assessment uses mobile data collection to assess housing damage through all earthquake affected districts.
